## What it is

Using Express.js I created API routes to execute functions needed for the supplied front end code to operate correctly.

## What was used
* HTML/CSS for front end
* JavaScript for functionality
* Express.js for the server setup
* fs node for the read/write/delete files
* nanoid node to generate a unique ID
* Heroku to host the server

## Usage

This application allows you to create and save notes. Once a note is written a save icon will appear to give the user the ability to save the file. The user is also able to delete old notes they don't need anymore.
* creating the note executes the POST action.
* looking through notes already made executes the GET action.
